Author: Dmytro Chesniuk

## Description

- Slay your way through your open world level, hacking and slashing creatures, breaking pots and collecting treasure and souls, and try to keep your health and stamina high!

- Enemy behavior that can be reused for various creature types. Character that is able to pick up and equip better and better weapons as she slays stronger and stronger monsters and collects loot.
- Unreal Engine 5 features such as Motion Warping, Meta Sounds, Linked Anim Graphs, UE5's new retargeting system with IK Rigs and IK Retargeters, Leg IK with Control Rigs, visual effect creation in Niagara.
- Weapon equipping and combat. Calculation of directional hit reactions, using root motion animations to make enemies stumble in the correct direction based on the direction of impact.
- Enemies patrolling behavior, then chasing and attacking behavior. Smarter enemies with the use of UE5's Motion Warping system, warping enemy's location and rotation to make it hit the target more frequently, and making it harder to move out of harm's way.
- Breakable pots and vases using the Chaos destruction system, breakables spawn treasure when are broken, allowing player to collect loot and increment gold count in the HUD.
- Soul effect created in Niagara, and enemies that spawn souls upon death so player can gain experience points.
- Animation Blueprint Templates to reuse all of enemy code to create different types of enemies, from humanoids that wield weapons to creatures that bite, sting, and smash.
